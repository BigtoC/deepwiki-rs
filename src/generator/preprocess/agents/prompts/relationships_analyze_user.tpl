Please analyze the deep relationships between components based on the following component information and existing relationships:

## Core Component List
{}

## Identified Static Relationships
{}

Please analyze and identify:
1. Logical relationships between components (aggregation, composition, inheritance, etc.)
2. Architectural hierarchy relationships (upstream-downstream dependencies, same-level collaboration, etc.)
3. Data flow relationships (data transfer, state sharing, etc.)
4. Control flow relationships (call chains, event-driven, etc.)
5. Overall coupling degree assessment and optimization recommendations

The analysis should be based on the types, responsibilities, and existing dependency relationships of components.
